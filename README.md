A library project using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

This project has quite a bit more JavaScript than the ones I previously made, though it made for a great learning experience overall. Tt took in total around 2 weeks to finish up. There are certainly a few details that can be improved such as proper form validation and styling, and obviously progress tracking using Back end (which at the moment I'm sadly not able to implement).
I'm fairly content with the result, however, if I was to tackle this task again, I would make more use of objects and their properties. I made an honest mistake when filling myLibrary[] with objects, which are not really book objects but figure HTML containers with their respective book values attached, not the prettiest nor most functional approach, but it does the trick for the most part.

Please try it out at --> https://sosarollie.github.io/library/ (Not currently supporting progress tracking).
